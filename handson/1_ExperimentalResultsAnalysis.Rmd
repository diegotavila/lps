#Introduction
We were tasked to check about the experimental results found in the folder "1_Experiences".


#File 1 - Opening

```{r}
library(readr);
Exp1 <- read_csv("1_Experiences/Exp1.csv");
Exp1;
```


I have no idea what this is. An index column, a double column and another index without a column name?

#File 2 - Opening

```{r}
library(readr);
Exp2 <- read_csv("1_Experiences/Exp2.csv");
Exp2;
```

#File 3 - Opening

```{r}
library(readr);
Exp5 <- read_csv("1_Experiences/Exp3.csv");
Exp5;
```
#File 4 - Opening

```{r}
library(readr);
Exp5 <- read_csv("1_Experiences/Exp4.csv");
Exp5;
```
#File 5 - Opening

```{r}
library(readr);
Exp5 <- read_csv("1_Experiences/Exp5.csv");
Exp5;
```

I still have no idea.
